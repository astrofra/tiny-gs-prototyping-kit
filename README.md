# Tiny GS Prototyping kit
Tiny GameStart3D Prototyping Kit

Circa 2010, I started to gather a series of code snippets that tend to be useful to my gamedev experiments (TigSource contests, Game Jams, pet projects...).
This is an archive of this project, for historical purpose. This kit is meant to work with the [GameStart 3D](https://www.youtube.com/@GameStart3D) engine.
